        I'm an industrious and highly-motivated individual, demonstrated in having moved to London at 18 years old to start my career as an Apprentice Test Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kurtgeiger.com">Kurt Geiger</a>.<br/>
        Before my apprenticeship finished, I was promoted to Junior Test Engineer, followed closely by a promotion to Security Engineer.<br/><br/>
        Entirely self-taught, I code with Python, JavaScript, Ruby and PHP daily. Plenty of AWS experience too.
